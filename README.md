# SoftDocLinker

SoftDocLinker (Software Documentation Linker) is a place where all relevant software documentation can be linked.
It can be hard to maintain dozens of documentation for different project while providing a central place to view them.

SoftDocLinker aims to solve this problem with a huge simplicity. It has been build to make it as easy as possible to have a
dynamic page for your documentations on GitHub Pages without any external service.

### Q & A

Q: Is it possible to use SoftDocLinker on an external Webserver which does not run on GitHub Pages?
A: Yes, it is! Look at "Install on a Webserver" for further information.

Q: How is it possible to have a dynamic page on GitHub Pages without a backend?
A: We're using a JSon file to store the required Meta-Data which is then requested using a AJAX request.
So you just have to modify the JSon file and push your changes to GitHub to update anything.

### I want to make SoftDocLinker better!

SoftDocLinker is a simple project, so just make your changes, create a pull request.
When your changes are nice, they will be merged.

You can add anything you want or what you think that is should be implemented.
There's only one restriction: Everything needs to be compatible to GitHub Pages.
