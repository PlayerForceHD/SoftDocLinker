# SoftDocLinker

SoftDocLinker (Software Documentation Linker) is a place where all relevant software documentation can be linked together.
It can be hard to maintain dozens of documentation for different projects while providing a central place to view them.
SoftDocLinker aims to solve this problem with a huge simplicity. It has been build to make it as easy as possible to have a
dynamic page for your documentations on GitHub Pages without any external service.

## Current state of development
SoftDocLinker v2.0.0 is currently in development. That's why this README is that empty. 
But don't worry, the working versions of v1.1.1 are still available as release!

The target of v2.0.0 is to use modern technologies and improvements which includes:
 - Vue
 - TypeScript
 - Less
 - Better QA

The README will change from time to time, so stay tuned!
